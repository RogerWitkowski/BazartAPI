As your Codecool Journey comes closer to its conclusion, the time has come for a final Teamwork Project that will put to test all of the programming skills you've obtained so far (and some new ones you will learn on the way)!

There is an urban legend about revealing secrets on GitHub.😬
Unfortunately I did this😱 and had to delete my previous repository with a history of all commits😭🤦‍♂️
This mistake gave me a great lesson on how to keep app secrets safe.💪
I took a screenshot of the commit history which I will share with you below:
